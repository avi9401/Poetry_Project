    story:  ` in Jammu: the city of temples, there is a house.
      On the other side of Tawi, past the old bridge, i sit in my memory;
      she's talking to me, "earn so i can be free," as my heart drowns in summer.
      "it's unbearable," i say -- "the weather hasn't been kind to you"
      i wait for her to say something but she's busy again - "i have so much to do.. why don't you settle here and make my life easier," she says with a forced smile.
      On the other side of Tawi, past the old bridge, i sit in my memory;
      perhaps one day i can give her the world, the one she is promised.
      here on the foothills of the mighty Himalayas, on the other side of the tunnel, i wonder.
      perhaps i can leave while i still can, younger than i remember, or have i been old and it's merely a dream?
      have the city swallowed my memories to keep her relevance alive.
      is she just a figment of her many tangled roads, the tree sitting on the three hills, and disjointed neighborhoods?
      by the river Tawi - where i once spent the evening swimming in the sweet embrace of liquor, and in bosom of a welcoming morrow
      overlooking the new bridge, thinking to myself, 'how beautiful is home today'.
      or making out in the backseat of a confidant's car as we travel through the sidhra road, and she says to me, "do you think this will never end?"
      and before i can tell her the truth - i see a fleeting glimpse of silver; and there i am -- in tomorrow -- far from the edges of the mighty Himalayas.
      i take out my phone, i need to see what time it is, and there on the screen, it says it's 32 degrees of summer in jammu, still -- and i burst into tears.
      On the other side of Tawi, past the old bridge, i am my memory.`,

    poem: `
sound of wilderness
has come to pass

machines of men
have come to age  

children no longer
go outside

it is not safe to
breathe

the traffic is
too much

and streets
are all crowded

old buses are filled
with people who do
not have time to live

there are no
stars in the sky

the sun is masked
by the tall buildings

water is no
longer free

fire is now
expensive

the night is
never dark

pierced by the
screams of a thousand
lights

without hope
or the warm sun

tired and
angry

people watch the
tall buildings

stare them
down

watch the
neon signs
street lights

cars, trees
and music

pass them
by

one by
one

they are
forgotten

placed inside
decaying

old crowded
buses

one by
one

they become
so many

a town
a city
a slum

that speaks of
nothing

not a word

only silence and
more silence

and the silence
becomes so heavy

crushing dreams
of every new born

until the silence
begets a scream

begets a machine
with a hammer

that knocks
on their feeble
doors

flatten their
denude walls

for opulent men living in
the silver clouds

in tall buildings with
neon signs

men who
own

hope

the sun
the buildings
the mountains
expensive cars
diamond rings
salaries
army

old crowded
buses

traffic and
winter smog

birds chirping
by the windows

voices talking
in the room

people tired
and bothered

hunch over in
their despair

coiled up in
corners

waiting for
the batteries
to run out

suffering in
silence

telling their
fractured stories

that speak of
nothing

not a word

only silence and
more silence

until the silence
becomes so heavy

that speaks of
nothing

not a word
only silence  

until the silence
begets a scream

begets a machine
with a hammer

that knocks on
feeble doors

flatten the
rustic walls

to mine the rubble
and mint more sky for
opulent men living in
the silver clouds

men who
own

hope

the sun
the river
the moon
the mountain
summer
spring

golden sunsets
expensive cars
exquisite laughter

each worth more
than a lifetime

of impoverished
daughters and their
sons

angry fathers and
women they beat

mothers and
whores and
beggars and

millions upon
millions

without hope
or the bright sun

silent as
a scream

silent as
a whisper

silent as
violence

and it speaks
of nothing

not a word

only silence and
more silence

passed down
impoverished
malnutritioned

millions upon
millions

such is the
world

without hope
or the bright sun

each laugh as expensive
as an entire lifetime

suffering in
silence.`,
